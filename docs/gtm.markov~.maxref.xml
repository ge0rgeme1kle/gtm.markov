<digest>An external for generating second-order Markov chains.</digest>
<description>Markovian processes work by deriving the result of the current calculation according to the outcome of those which have preceded it. First-order Markov chains produce results that are subject solely to the influence of the immediately preceding result - i.e., they have "short memories". Accordingly, the results of first-order Markovian generation can appear somewhat random at surface level, despite the underlying rules of generation. Second- and third-order Markov chains are more appropriate for use within algorithmic/generative music due to their longer "memories" and dependence on the previous two or three results respectively when generating new values. Second- and third-order Markovian processes both produce patterns that could be described as "self-similar" - i.e., they retain a clearly discernible connection to the source material from which the transition matrix is compiled. Oftentimes, however, third-order Markov chains can be conducive to limited variation in output relative to the source material, whereas second-order Markov chains tend to yield results that strike a pleasing balance between novelty and familiarity.</description>

            The leftmost inlet receives a list of integers in the range of 0-127, up to 128 numbers in length. This could be a monophonic melody contained in a MIDI file or a series of automation values for a synthesis parameter, such filter cutoff frequency.
            The data set arriving at the leftmost inlet is used to compile a transition matrix, in which each sequential value pair is stored alongside every value that follows on from it at any stage in the input list. A bang is outputted from the object's rightmost outlet once this process is complete.
            A new list of integers sent into the leftmost inlet overwrites the previously stored transition matrix.

            Due to the time taken for note/value generation, gtm.markov~ introduces a single sample vector of latency to the signal path. For convenience when combining gtm.markov~ with objects such as mc.midiplayer~, which requires both a MIDI note number and phasor/ramp input signal (with @triggermode 0) to generate note output, the phasor/ramp input signal sent to the second inlet of gtm.markov~ is subject to a single sample vector delay inside the object before being released from the leftmost outlet.
