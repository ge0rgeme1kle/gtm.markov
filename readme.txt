This package is built around two external objects for generating second-order Markov chains: gtm.markov and gtm.markov~. gtm.markov is an event-based object that calculates new output values upon receipt of a bang at its middle inlet, while gtm.markov~ is the signal-based counterpart to gtm.markov and calculates new output values upon phase reset of an incoming phasor/ramp signal arriving at its middle inlet. Both objects receive a list of integers in the range of 0-127 and up to 128 elements in length at their leftmost inlet, from which the internal transition matrix is compiled. Sending a new list of integers into the leftmost inlet overwrites the previously stored transition matrix. A bang received at the rightmost inlet of both objects resets the generation of values without clearing the internally stored transition matrix.

In addition to the external objects themselves, this package contains a number of example patchers, as well as RNBO-based versions of the external objects and accompanying video tutorials detailing how the externals were developed and compiled using RNBO and codebox.
